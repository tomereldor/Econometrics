# Panel DATA from http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wgreene/Econometrics/PanelDataSets.htm  
# World Health Organization Panel Data on Health Care Attainment:  191 Countries, 5 Years (Some countries fewer)

# This data has been used by many researchers to study the Health Care Survey assembled by WHO as part of the YEAR 2000 # World Health Report. On the course bibliography, see, for example, Greene (2004a).  Note, variables marked * were updated # with more recent sources in Greene (2004a). Missing COMPs for some of the variables in this data set are filled by using # fitted COMPs from a linear regression.  To set the proper sample for panel data analysis, use observations for which SMALL # = 0.  To obtain the balanced panel, then use only observations with GROUPTI = 5.
# The variables in the file are
# COMP = composite measure of health care attainment; LCOMP = logCOMP
# DALE = Disability adjusted life expectancy (other measure); LDALE = logDALE
# YEAR = 1993,...,1997;  TIME = 1,2,3,4,5;  T93, T94, T95, T96, T97 = YEAR dummy variables
# HEXP = per capita health expenditure; LHEXP = logHEXP; LHEXP2 = log-squaredHEXP
# HC3 = educational attainment; LHC = logHC3; LHC2 = log-squaredHC3; LHEXPHC = logHEXP * logHC3
# SMALL = indicator for states, provinces, etc. SMALL > 0 implies internal political unit, = 0 implies country observation
# COUNTRY = number assigned to country
# STRATUM = another country indicator
# GROUPTI = number of observations when SMALL = 0. Usually 5, some = 1, one country = 4.
# OECD = dummy variable for OECD country (30 countries)
# GINI = gini coefficient for income inequality
# GEFF = world bank measure of government effectiveness*
# VOICE = world bank measure of democratization of the political process*
# TROPICS = dummy variable for tropical location
# POPDEN = population density*
# PUBTHE = proportion of health expenditure paid by public authorities
# GDPC = normalized per capita GDP; LGDPC = logGDPC; LGDPC2 = log-squaredGDPC
